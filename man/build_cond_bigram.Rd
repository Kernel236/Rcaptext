\title{Build conditional probabilities for bigrams}
\usage{
build_cond_bigram(freq_bi)
}
\arguments{
\item{freq_bi}{A data frame containing bigram frequencies with required columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{w1}: First word of the bigram (character)
  \item \code{w2}: Second word of the bigram (character) 
  \item \code{n}: Frequency count of the bigram (numeric)
}
Optional columns like \code{p} (probability) are preserved if present.}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to the input but with an additional column:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{p_cond}: Conditional probability P(w2 | w1) (numeric)
  }
  The conditional probability is calculated as n / sum(n) for each w1.
}
\description{
Computes conditional probabilities P(w2 | w1) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
from bigram frequency data. This is essential for building language models that can
predict the next word given the previous word.
}
\examples{
# Create sample bigram data
bigrams <- data.frame(
  w1 = c("the", "the", "a", "a"),
  w2 = c("cat", "dog", "cat", "bird"),
  n = c(10, 5, 3, 2)
)

# Calculate conditional probabilities
result <- build_cond_bigram(bigrams)
print(result)
# Shows P(cat|the) = 10/15 = 0.67, P(dog|the) = 5/15 = 0.33, etc.

}
