\title{Sample Text Corpus by Source}
\usage{
sample_corpus(
  corpus,
  prop = NULL,
  n_per_source = NULL,
  seed = 123,
  min_chars = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corpus}{A tibble with columns \code{source} and \code{text}, typically
from \code{\link{load_corpus}}.}

\item{prop}{Numeric. Proportion to sample within each source (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
Use either \code{prop} OR \code{n_per_source}, not both.}

\item{n_per_source}{Integer. Number of lines to sample within each source
(e.g., 50000). Use either \code{prop} OR \code{n_per_source}, not both.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 123.}

\item{min_chars}{Integer. Drop lines with fewer than this many characters 
before sampling. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the same structure as input (\code{source}, \code{text}), 
  but sampled according to specified parameters.
}
\description{
This function creates a random sample from the corpus, either by proportion
or by absolute number of lines per source (blogs/news/twitter).
}
\details{
The function filters out NA values and very short lines before sampling.
Sampling is performed within each source group to maintain representativeness
across different text types.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Sample 5\% from each source
small_corpus <- sample_corpus(corpus, prop = 0.05, seed = 123)

# Sample exactly 20,000 lines from each source
medium_corpus <- sample_corpus(corpus, n_per_source = 20000, seed = 42)

# Sample with minimum character filter
clean_sample <- sample_corpus(corpus, prop = 0.1, min_chars = 10, seed = 456)
}
