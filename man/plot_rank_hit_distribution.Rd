\title{Plot Distribution of Hit Ranks}
\usage{
plot_rank_hit_distribution(
  per_case,
  title = "Distribuzione del rank della prima hit"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{per_case}{Tibble from \code{evaluate_accuracy_at_k()$per_case}.
Must contain \code{rank_hit} column.}

\item{title}{Character. Plot title (default shows Italian, customize as needed).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing percentage of hits at each rank (1 = top-1, 2 = top-2, etc.).
}
\description{
Visualizes at which position (rank) the correct word appears in predictions.
Only shows cases where target was found (excludes NA/misses).
}
\details{
This plot helps understand prediction quality:
- High bar at rank=1 → model often gets top prediction correct
- High bars at rank=2,3 → model needs to show multiple suggestions
- Excludes cases where target not in top-K (those are counted separately)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
results <- evaluate_accuracy_at_k(test_data, tri, bi, uni, ks = c(1, 3, 5))
p <- plot_rank_hit_distribution(results$per_case)
print(p)
}
